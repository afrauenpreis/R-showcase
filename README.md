# R-showcase
Some examples of the works I have been apart of
The Radiated Rats rmd was to manage/analyse data from the Guinan radiation lab
The Vineyard Analysis rmd was to manage/analyse data from the Dr. Watts lab at Cal Poly SLO
Bioperm is a mini package designed to be used for permuation analysis and is still under construction
All work has been done under the guidance of Dr. Kelly Bodwin at Cal Poly SLO
